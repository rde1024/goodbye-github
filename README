Now that Github has been bought by an entity antithetical to its former
purposes, I'm done.  I'll continue to maintain a Github account in order to
retain my username, but from now on, I'll be hosting any git repos I happen to
want to share from my own hardware.  When and if I ever get around to rehosting
the stuff that used to be here, I'll update this file to point to it all.  If
you want that to happen sooner rather than never, poke me somehow.
